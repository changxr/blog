Vacuum of proper level is one of necessary condition for the yield of high quality of coating. 

Firstly, producing vacuum is a way of controlling reactivity of the deposition process. Gas compositions in the air can be considered as contamination of the coating. Especially, oxidation is to prevent, otherwise the yielded purity of coating is low, that means, for example, the reflective effect of the metallized film or its barrier function will be poor. How much can the gas compositions as contaminants affect the purity of coating? It depends mainly on the relative arrival rates of coating material and the contaminant. The higher the level of vacuum, the less negative effect on coating quality. 

The second advantage used in metallizing is that, with less gas molecular, there will be less collisions, so that there will be few energy losses as the deposit materials condense on the underlying substrate, thus the coating will be quit adhesive.

So, ensuring the coating purity and adhesive performance is main reason we need vacuum in metallizing process.  the indicator for purity is the time to form the monolayer, the indicator for adhesive property is the mean free path.

Mean free path is a variable depends on the particle size, pressure and temperature, however, using the following formula is a convenient way to calculate the mean free pathï¼š  
$$ mfp = \frac{6.4\times 10^{-3}}{P} \text{cm}, \; \text{where P is the pressure in mbar}$$. If distance between thermal source and substrate is 0.5 m, we need a pressure of the order of $10 ^ {-4} mbar$ during metallizing to prevent gas scattering of the depositing material. It worth noting that the term be used is "mean" free path. so that scattering is statistically possible.

The time to form a monolayer, which relates to the purity of layer, is also a variable of pressure. Assume that it is sure that the particle will stick to the substrate if a the particle hits the surface, then, at pressure of the order of $10^{-3}$ mbar, the time to form a monolayer will be in 1 ms, and of $10 ^ {-6}$ mbar order the time is 1 s. The most frequent used pressure in metallizing is $10 ^ {-4}$, and the time to form monolayer is about 0.01 s. Under this pressure, at the winding speed of 600m/min(film passes through deposition zone in 0.1 s), the rate of contamination is about 1 - 2%. 

We can find that if the vacuum level is too high, the time to form monolayer will be longer, there could be a tradeoff between less gas molecular and long time to form layer.

Overall, for metallizing, especially for aluminizing, $10 ^ {-4}$ mbar is a good choice.
