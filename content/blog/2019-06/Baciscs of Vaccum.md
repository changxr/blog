It is not easy to image what is vacuum, however, everyone knows its opposite: a open air space. Air is a mixture of gases, the relative volumes(in percent) of gas compositions in dry air is as following:


| Gas Composition | Symbol | Percentage |
|----------------|--------|----------|
| Nitrogen   | `$ N_2 $` | 78.08 |
| Oxygen   | `$ O_2 $` | 20.95 |
| Argon   | `$ Ar $` | 0.93 |
| Carbon dioxide   | `$ CO_2 $` | 0.03 |
| $\vdots$  | $\vdots$ | $\vdots$ |
| Hydrogen   | `$ H_2 $` | 0.00005 |

Furthermore, if the air is not dry, there is water vapor whose range varies form 0.6 to 6 percentage.

In general, materials can be in three form: solid, liquid, or gas. The transformation is related to the change of  structure: 

| Form of Material  | Distance between Atoms | Atoms' position
|------------------|------------------------|-----------|
| solid             | closely                 | fixed      |
| liquid            | great                   | disorder    |
| gas               | greater                 | more disorder|

The atoms or molecular in gas, for example in air, have some features worth noting:
* the number of atoms or molecular is large, round `$2 \times 10^{19} / \text{cm}^3$`;
* free to move in any direction and  in
constant motion at speeds of circa
1650 kph;
* they collide with each other or surfaces at the rate`$10^{10}$` per second, thus, the direction and motion they move are random, and average distance a atom has to travel before a collision(mean free path) is very short, about 100 nm.
* 
A Vacuum can be produced by emptying a chamber of gas. In the perfect case, there is no atom or molecular in vacuum and therefor no collision. But, there is no absolute vacuum. However, we say there is vacuum if less gas molecular per unit volume exists than in the atmosphere surrounding. So, in vacuum, there is less collisions.

Moreover, atoms or molecular have mass, and due to gravitational pull, they exert force on a surface by hitting and bouncing off it. Because there are less gas molecular in vacuum, less force will be exerted on the surface per unit area, which means less pressure. In term of pressure, we can quantify vacuum. The most important reference value is atmospheric pressure at sea level， 45°N latitude, and a temperature of 0°C, this value of pressure is defined as standard atmosphere(std atm), which is as same as 1 kg force per c㎡. Following unit convention is very usual:
`$$ 1 \;\text{std atm}  \cong  101,325 \;\text{Pa}  \cong  1.01325 \;\text{bar}  \cong  760 \;\text{torr} $$`   
The level of vacuum could be quantified in terms of pressure. The less the amount of gas molecular, the lower the pressure exerted and the higher the level of vacuum:  
1. `$ 1 - 1013 \;\text{mbar}$`: low, soft, poor, rough vacuum;
2. `$10^{-3} - 1 \;\text{mbar}$`: medium, moderate vacuum;
3. `$10^{-7} - 10^{-3}\;\text{mbar}$`: high, hard, good vacuum;
4. below `$10^{-7} \;\text{ mbar}$`: ultrahigh vacuum.
